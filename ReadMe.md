# Quantum Annealing

Recently, I came across quantum annealing, which is a super smart way in utilizing principles of quantum mechanics to solve time intensive analytical problems in a shorter time frame. The script
*ex1_OneDimQuantAnnealing.py*
describes a double well potential with the form 
$$V(x)=x^4-x^2$$
for which we try to find the ground state. We already know the ground states and only want to demonstrate a possible process.

## Steps to Implement Quantum Annealing
### Define the problem Hamiltonian: 
The Hamiltonian representing the problem to be minimized.
### Define the driver Hamiltonian:
A Hamiltonian that induces quantum fluctuations.
### Interpolate between the driver and problem Hamiltonians:
Use a time-dependent Hamiltonian that gradually switches from the driver to the problem Hamiltonian.
### Solve the Time-Dependent Schrödinger Equation (TDSE):
Use numerical methods to solve the TDSE for the time-dependent Hamiltonian.
### Extract the solution:
Analyze the final state to find the solution to the optimization problem.
### Example:
One-dimensional Quantum Annealing

Let's consider a simple example where we solve for the ground state of a double-well potential using quantum annealing.

1. Define the Hamiltonians

Driver Hamiltonian (transverse field term):
$$H_D = -\Delta \sigma_x$$

Problem Hamiltonian:
$$H_P = V(x)$$
​where $V(x)$ is a double-well-potential.

2. Time-dependent Hamiltonian

​$$H(t)=[1-s(t)]H_D +s(t)H_P$$
where $s(t)$ is a schedule function that changes from $0$ to $1$ over time.

3. Solve the TDSE

We'll use the Crank-Nicolson method to solve the TDSE numerically.
